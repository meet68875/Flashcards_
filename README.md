## 📦 Features

1. **Create Custom Flashcards:**

   - Users have the ability to craft personalized flashcards by entering group information along with multiple terms and their corresponding details. This feature empowers users to tailor their learning experience to specific subjects or topics.

2. **Character Limit Validation:**

   - The system intelligently validates user inputs and provides immediate feedback. If the user exceeds the maximum character limit, the application displays a visually distinct error by highlighting the input fields with a red border and presenting a clear error message in red text.

3. **Dynamic Term Section:**

   - Users can dynamically manage terms within the flashcards. This includes adding new terms, deleting existing ones, and activating a read-only mode for specific terms. This flexibility ensures a customizable and adaptive learning experience.

4. **Persistent User Data:**

   - The application employs local storage to store user data persistently. This means that users can seamlessly pick up where they left off, and their created flashcards will be retained even after closing the browser or navigating away from the application.

5. **Flashcard Block Deletion:**

   - Users have the capability to delete entire flashcard blocks from the show page. This feature provides a streamlined way for users to manage their flashcards, allowing for efficient organization and removal of unnecessary content.

6. **Download, Print, and Share:**
   - The show page offers convenient options for users to download flashcards, print them for offline use, and share them with others. This enhances the usability of the flashcards beyond the application, facilitating collaborative learning and knowledge sharing.
